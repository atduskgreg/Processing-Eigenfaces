## Processing-Eigenfaces

This is an example of using the [P-Eigenface](https://code.google.com/p/p-eigenface/) library to do face recognition in Processing. It uses some sample images from the [Face94 face photo database from Math-Intersect-Programming](http://code.google.com/p/math-intersect-programming/downloads/list). Their accompanying [blog post on eigenfaces](http://jeremykun.wordpress.com/2011/07/27/eigenfaces/) is also highly recommmended.
